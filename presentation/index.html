					<p>Introduction</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						Hello everyone. Today, we're diving into the world of MongoDB, a powerful NoSQL database.
						As front-end developers, you're accustomed to crafting engaging user experiences, but what happens behind the scenes is equally crucial.
						Let's explore how MongoDB fits into the backend ecosystem and why it's worth our attention.

						<aside class="notes">
							Before delving into MongoDB, let's quickly recap what databases are.
							Think of them as organized collections of data. Traditionally, we've used relational databases like MySQL or PostgreSQL.
							They excel at structured data but can become rigid as applications evolve.
							Then non-relational databases can help us. What's the difference between them?

						<span>Relationships in a relational DB</span>
						<aside class="notes">
							A relational database uses tables to store data, where each table contains records with attributes.
							Relationships between tables are provided through keys.
							A non-relational database can use various data models such as document-oriented, key-value, columnar or graph.
							They do not require a strict schema and can store data in a more flexible form.

					<p>What is Mongo DB?</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						Documents are grouped into collections - analogous to tables in relational databases,
						but they do not have a strict schema, and documents in a collection can have different sets of fields.
						MongoDB is a leading NoSQL database, known for its document-oriented structure.
						Instead of tables, it stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, making it a natural fit for JavaScript-heavy applications.
						MongoDB is free to use and published under the AGPL.

						<p>Documents</p>
						<img src="./assets/images/slide_4_1.png" alt="document of mongo db" height="328">
						<aside class="notes">
							A basic unit of data in MongoDB, similar to rows in relational databases.
							Documents are a collection of key-value pairs, where the values can be simple data types (strings, numbers, booleans),
							arrays, or nested documents.

						<p>Collections</p>
						<img src="./assets/images/slide_4_2.png" alt="collections of documents" height="328">
						<aside class="notes">
							Groups of documents, similar to tables in relational databases, but without a fixed schema,

					<section>
						<p>Fields</p>
						<img src="./assets/images/slide_4_3.png" alt="field of document" height="328">
						<aside class="notes">
							In MongoDB, fields are the names and values that make up documents in collections, comparable to columns in relational databases.
							Fields can have various data types such as strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, nested objects, dates, and others.

						<p>As frontend developers, why should we consider MongoDB?</p>
						<ul>
							<li>JSON-Like Documents.</li>
							<li>Scalability.</li>
							<li>Performance.</li>
							<li>Flexibility.</li>

						<p>JSON-Like Documents:</p>
						<img src="./assets/images/slide_5_1.png" alt="BSON format" height="280">
						<aside class="notes">
							Data stored in a format we're already familiar with, simplifying development.
							MongoDB was designed from its inception to be a database focused on delivering great development experience.
							JSON’s ubiquity made it the obvious choice for representing data structures in MongoDB’s document data model.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>Scalability:</p>
						<img src="./assets/images/slide_5_2.jpg" alt="scalability" height="400">
						<aside class="notes">
							MongoDB's distributed architecture allows us to seamlessly scale as our application grows,
							allowing us to distribute data across multiple nodes and provide better performance as our workload grows.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>Performance:</p>
						<img src="./assets/images/slide_5_3_1.jpg" alt="NoSQL outperform" height="196">
						<img src="./assets/images/slide_5_3_2.jpeg" alt="memory consumption" height="264">
						<aside class="notes">
							Its document-oriented model often results in faster query execution,
							improving the user experience, especially if the data is stored denormalized and does not require complex joins.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>Flexibility:</p>
						<img src="./assets/images/slide_5_4.svg" alt="NoSQL outperform" height="450">
						<aside class="notes">
							There is no need to change the database schema when requirements change,
							which increases flexibility since adding new attributes or changing table structures can be a complex and expensive process.
